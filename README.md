# Overview

This is a demonstration project using the Arcade library for Python to create a basic Brick Breaker type game. 

The object of the game is to score points be knocking a ball into bricks. The player has to keep the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen by moving a paddle into the ball's path. The player can alter the ball's left'right speed by moving the paddle during the collision with the ball, allowing the player to direct the ball towards different bricks. While points are obtained by breaking bricks, one point is lost each time the ball impacts the paddle, incentivizing the player to get as many bricks as possible per hit from the paddle. The game progresses through 4 levels, each with a unique brick layout.

I choose to create this game to gain experience with the Arcade library. This project has helped me learn the fundamentals of Arcade so that I can complete more ambitious projects.

# Future Work

* Add an instructions screen within the game
* Create different brick types, some of which have a chance of altering the game (adding an extra ball, changing the paddle size, etc)
* Implement random brick layout generations so that the game continues so long as the player has lives
